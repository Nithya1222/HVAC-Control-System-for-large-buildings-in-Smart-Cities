# HVAC-Control-System-for-large-buildings-in-Smart-Cities

Finding the optimal balance between electricity demand and production constrained to
economic and comfort variables requires intelligent decision and control. This project
includes the formulation of three models that optimize control of a heating, ventilation
and air conditioning (HVAC) system in an experimental room, which are coupled with
two thermal models of the indoor temperature.
